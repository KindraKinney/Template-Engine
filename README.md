## User Story

As a manager, I want to be able to access my team's basic information by generating a webpage so I can have access to their email and github usernames easily.

## Usage 

The user will be prompted to enter their employees name, id, email, role and any additional parameters based on what they select as their role (Manager, Engineer or Intern).

When all prompts have been answered for each employee and user selects "No" to add more employees, the employee cards will append to the starter html file and generate a full web page displaying all company employees.
